    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This outrageously easy "ice cream" is just the sort of dessert to please
      everyone at the table – the vegans, the lactose-intolerant, the paleo
      enthusiasts, the picky children. Just toss four frozen bananas into a
      blender and give it a good whirl. If you like soft-serve consistency, eat
      it right away (and adding a few tablespoons of milk to the blender
      wouldn't hurt, but it's not necessary). For more traditional scoops,
      freeze it in an airtight container, and dole out as you would the Ben &
      Jerry's. Consider adding a spoonful of peanut butter, Nutella or honey; a
      handful of chocolate chips or almonds; or a ½ teaspoon of powdered ginger,
      cardamom or cinnamon.

        Peel the bananas, cut them in 2- to 3-inch chunks and place them in a
        freezer bag in the freezer for at least 6 hours. Remove and blend in a
        blender until smooth. Serve immediately, or freeze in an airtight
        container for at least 2 hours. Scoop and serve.

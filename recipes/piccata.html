    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Fucking delicious.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>3 tablespoons Olive Oil</li>
      <li>1 head Garlic halved horizontally</li>
      <li>4 chicken breasts</li>
      <li>Sea Salt & freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>2 sprigs Rosemary</li>
      <li>200 ml Dry White Wine</li>
      <li>200 ml chicken stock</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Capers drained</li>
      <li>100 ml crème fraiche</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat the olive oil in a pan and add the garlic halves, cut side down.
        Allow the garlic to infuse the oil over a medium-low heat for a minute,
        then increase the heat slightly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Season the chicken chops with salt and pepper and add to the pan. Throw
        in the rosemary and fry the chicken for 11/2–2 minutes on each side
        until golden brown. Remove and discard the garlic and herbs from the
        pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour off the excess oil from the pan, then add the wine, scraping the
        bottom to deglaze. Add the chicken stock and bring to the boil and let
        it bubble until reduced by half.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in the capers and crème fraîche and simmer for a minute or two
        until the sauce is the desired consistency. Season generously with salt
        and pepper to taste.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spoon the sauce into the middle of six warm plates and place the chicken
        on top. Serve immediately accompanied by some boiled jersey royals.
